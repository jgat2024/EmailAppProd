# EmailApp

A full-stack foundation for a secure email orchestration platform. The Node.js API exposes JWT-authenticated endpoints for managing users, email accounts, cached messages, and webhook notifications while handling encrypted credentials, rate limiting, and polling workers for IMAP/POP3 mailboxes. A lightweight EJS-powered admin dashboard scaffold is bundled for future monitoring enhancements.

## Features

- **Express + Sequelize + Supabase Postgres** data layer with migrations for users, email accounts, cached emails, and webhooks.
- **JWT authentication** (`/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`) with bcrypt password hashing and role-aware authorization for administrative routes.
- **Encrypted email credentials** using AES-256-GCM and environment-controlled secrets.
- **Email account CRUD** endpoints supporting OAuth token persistence, SMTP sending via Nodemailer, and placeholders for IMAP/POP3 polling (Node IMAP + POP3) that cache inbound messages.
- **Webhook management** with signed payload delivery, retry logic, and structured logging.
- **Security middleware** including Celebrate/Joi validation, global rate limiting, and guidance for HTTPS/TLS termination.
- **Docker + docker-compose** workflow alongside a `.env.example` to accelerate local or cloud deployment (e.g., DigitalOcean App Platform or Droplets).
- **Admin dashboard scaffold** served under `/api/admin` for extending user/log oversight views.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (Node 20 LTS recommended)
- A Supabase project with database credentials (connection string or discrete host/user/password)
- OpenSSL-compatible environment for TLS (production)
- Docker Desktop (optional but recommended for parity with deployment)

## Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file and adjust secrets:

 ```bash
  cp server/.env.example server/.env
  ```

2. Update `server/.env` with production-ready values:
   - `JWT_SECRET`, `WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_SECRET`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` should be high-entropy strings.
   - Provide either `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (preferred) or the discrete `SUPABASE_DB_HOST`, `SUPABASE_DB_USER`, `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_DB_NAME`, and `SUPABASE_DB_PORT` values from the Supabase dashboard.
   - Keep `SUPABASE_DB_SSL=true` unless you are tunnelling traffic through an internal network that does not require TLS.
   - If your host lacks IPv6 egress (DigitalOcean App Platform, some firewalls), leave `DB_FORCE_IPV4=true` so Sequelize resolves Supabase to IPv4 automatically. Optionally set `SUPABASE_DB_HOST_IPV4` to the `A` record returned from `dig +short db.<project>.supabase.co` for deterministic routing.

3. (Optional) configure OAuth client secrets for providers you intend to support. These values are persisted in the `email_accounts` table.

## Local Development

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run supabase:setup   # optional once-off to create tables immediately
npm run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:4000/api`. Helpful routes:

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/email-accounts`
- `POST /api/email-accounts/:id/send`
- `GET /api/webhooks`
- `GET /api/admin` (requires an authenticated admin JWT)

Use the `/api/health` endpoint for liveness checks.

### Database Migrations

- The application automatically synchronizes Sequelize models with Supabase on start-up.
- Run migrations manually (optional) with `npm run db:migrate` if you prefer using the migration files over `sequelize.sync()`.
- Roll back the latest migration: `npm run db:migrate:undo`
- (Optional) add future seed scripts under `server/seeders/` and execute with `npm run db:seed`.

### Testing Webhooks Locally

For local webhook receivers, tools like [smee.io](https://smee.io/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) can tunnel public URLs. Register the URL via `/api/webhooks` and monitor delivery logs in the database or server logs (`winston`).

## Docker Workflow

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- `api`: builds from `server/Dockerfile`, applies environment variables from `server/.env`, and exposes port 4000.

Ensure tables exist inside the container (if you did not run the setup script locally):

```bash
docker compose exec api npm run supabase:setup
```

## HTTPS & Security Guidance

- Terminate TLS using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Traefik, or a managed load balancer). Point it at the Express service on port 4000.
- Enforce HTTPS-only cookies and secure headers using proxies (Helmet can be added if you require stricter CSP/HSTS rules).
- Rotate JWT and encryption keys periodically. Consider using a secrets manager (DigitalOcean Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.).
- In production, externalize the token blacklist into a durable cache (Redis) to coordinate logout across replicas.

## Deployment on DigitalOcean

1. **Droplet + Docker Compose**
   - Provision a Droplet (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) with Docker preinstalled.
   - Clone this repository and copy `.env` files (avoid committing secrets).
   - Run `docker compose up -d --build`.
   - Configure a firewall to allow ports 80/443. Database traffic stays within Supabase, so you do not need to expose Postgres locally.
   - Populate the Supabase environment variables in `server/.env` using the credentials from your Supabase project.

2. **App Platform**
   - Create a new App Platform service pointing to this repo.
   - Set the build path to `server/` with the default Node.js builder.
   - Configure environment variables via the App Platform dashboard (use the Supabase keys from `.env.example`).
   - Supply Supabase as the backing database by setting `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (or the discrete host/user/password variables).
   - Ensure `DB_FORCE_IPV4` remains enabled (default) or provide `SUPABASE_DB_HOST_IPV4` so the platform connects over IPv4-only networks.
   - Enable automatic HTTPS and scale worker counts as needed.

Each deployment automatically synchronizes Supabase tables on boot; optionally run `npm run supabase:setup` during release workflows for immediate schema creation.

## Extending the Admin Dashboard

The EJS view at `src/views/admin.ejs` acts as a stub. Suggested enhancements:

- Fetch webhook delivery metrics via new controller methods.
- Embed charts using Chart.js, React, or Vue; mount a SPA under `/admin` if you prefer a richer UI.
- Introduce server-sent events or WebSocket feeds for real-time monitoring of polling/SMTP activity.

## Logging & Monitoring

- Winston logs to STDOUT by default. Route container logs to your log aggregation platform (e.g., DigitalOcean Logging, Datadog, or ELK).
- Expand `logger` transports for file output if required.
- Instrument webhook retries and polling statistics by adding metrics exporters (Prometheus, StatsD).

## Next Steps

- Replace the in-memory JWT blacklist with Redis or another shared cache.
- Implement full IMAP message fetching inside `pollingService.processImapMessage`.
- Add integration/unit tests (Jest, Supertest) for critical flows.
- Harden OAuth flows with provider-specific implementations and refresh scheduling.
- Automate schema migrations using CI/CD pipelines.

Happy emailing!
